# Coding Standards

## Overall Standards
    Spacing should be proper

    Indentation should be proper

    Use comments to explain complex logic or document your code.



## HTML Coding Standards

    Use Lowercase: HTML tags, attributes, and values should be written in lowercase. 

    For example, <div>, <a href="example.com">.

    Indentation: Use consistent and logical indentation (4 spaces) 
    to make your code easier to read.

    Self-Closing Tags: Use self-closing tags for void elements, 

    e.g., <img src="image.jpg" /> instead of <img src="image.jpg">.

    Comments: Add comments to explain complex sections, especially if your HTML structure is intricate.

## JavaScript Coding Standards

    Use CamelCase: For variable and function names, use camelCase

    e.g., myVariableName, calculateTotalAmount().

    Indentation: Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) to improve code readability.

    Comments: Include comments to explain complex logic or document your code.

    Variables: Declare variables with var, let, or const keywords. Donâ€™t declare variables before you use them.

## CSS Coding Standards

    Use Lowercase with Hyphens: Write CSS class names and IDs in lowercase with hyphens for readability,
    e.g., .header-style, #main-content.

    Indentation: Use consistent indentation of 4 spaces.

    Comments: Add comments to describe the purpose of specific styles or sections.
